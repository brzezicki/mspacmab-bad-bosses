my mspacman / bad bosses / dilbert ROM hack

This rom hack is a fun hack I did to replace the Ms. Pacman bootleg (mame rom mspacmab) with characters resembling Dilbert. Originally I had given these "bosses" names from various famous "bad bosses" in movies but I"ve removed the names and replaced them with generic things people complain about at work.

This these roms can be installed on pacman hardware / (or ms pacman) they are derived from the "bootleg/un-encrypted" ms pacman files so you don't need the ms pacman daughterboard which is nice.
